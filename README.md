# MakeMyMacro
Automate malicious VBA macro for Word Doc.
Note: This is a Beta and needs lots of modifications

## How it works
Combines [macro_pack](https://github.com/sevagas/macro_pack) and [VBA-RunPE](https://github.com/itm4n/VBA-RunPE) to create obfuscated macro to run from the memory of Word. 

## How to run
For now just run **python makemymacro.py -h** to see the necessary arguments. Will add more documentation later.

## Disclaimer
I am not responsible with how and where you use this.
